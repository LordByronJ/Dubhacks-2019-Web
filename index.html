					<h2>What is Name?</h2>
					<p>HoloLens as an organizational tool. With the HoloLens, we will create a project where digital objects, (files such as text, word documents, videos, images, etc.) are stored in a virtual "physical" space. This allows us to both maximize our usage of spatial memory, for one, but also to better re-experience our past memories. Whereas in the past, all we could do is watch videos and images from our important life events from afar.  Now, we can truly immerse ourself in the experience with AR, without distancing ourselves too far from reality. By storing the images and videos in a virtual space, as well as being able to display it, we can re-experience memories with the same awe and amazement as we first experienced them in the real-world. Given the technical expertise of our team, we are confident we can make this project a reality and successfully in this hackathon.</p>
